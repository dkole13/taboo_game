## General information

“Taboo” is a card game where the goal is to explain as many words as you can for your team during 1 minute. The main difficulty is that the player is not allowed to use so-called “taboo words” during the explanation.

This is a 4-10 player game. It is suitable for teenagers and adults (some words may be difficult to explain for people younger than 12 years old). 

## Preparation 

1. At the moment, the game can only be run locally.
2. Click on the button `Начать!` to start the game
3. Follow the instructions and divide into two teams: red and blue. There should be an equal number of players in both teams. If there is an odd number of players, one of the teams will have one more player, it is not critical for the game process.
4. Seat in the chess order - so that near the both sides of the red team player will be blue team players and vice versa. When ready click on `Начать!`.
5. Then the game starts.

## The course of the game

After all the steps above the game starts. The game always starts with the red team’s turn.

1. On the screen the clue-giver will see a card with 1 word to explain and 5 taboo-words below (also the timer can be seen right to the card). The player explains the word for the team. 
2. If team names the word correctly, click on the button `Отгадано`, if they can not guess it (the word is very difficult or clue-giver has no ideas how to explain it), click on the button `Пропустить` to skip the card. When the red team guesses the word they gain 1 point, if they skip the card, 1 point goes to opponents (blue team). 
3. During the explanation opponents should see the card and make sure that taboo-words were not named. If they notice the naming of the restricted word (or the word with the same root), the card should be skipped. It means that the blue team will gain 1 point.
4. When the time (one minute) is over, there is unlimited time to guess the last word, but both teams can try to name the word (except for players who enforce the rules).
5. The game ends when all cards are guessed.

## End of the game 

The game can be played until the cards run out or the players get tired. The winner team can be determined by the total number of points.

## Special rules and restrictions

Clue-giver is not allowed to:
1. Use words with the same root as the word for explanation (for example, to explain word *дерево* by using *деревянный*);
2. To explain words by saying: “*Это рифмуется с…*”, “*Это похоже по звучанию на слово…*” etc. (for example, to explain word *бочка* by saying “*Это рифмуется со словом дочка*”);
3. Use gestures;
4. Name the first letter of the word, the number of letters in the word, number of syllables or any other formal characteristics.
